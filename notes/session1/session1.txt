dir -> shows files in a directory 
cd -> change the directory we are currently in
to run a command thru terminal: python filename.py

variable naming rules: 
- variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores, they can start with a letter or an
underscore, but not with a number. (legal: message_1, but 1_message is illegal)
- spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable
names. (greeting_message works, greeting message will cause errors)
- avoid using python keywords and function names as variable names; do not use words that Python has 
reserved for a particular grammatic purpose, such as the word print
- variable names should be short but descriptive, name is better than n, student_name is better than
s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name
